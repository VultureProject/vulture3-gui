### HOW TO SET A DIFFERENT LOG LEVEL FOR A SPECIFIC TEST OF YOUR MODULE


This is a bit of a trick, but it shows that with some reflection you can do whatever you want. ;)

1 - Set the 'self.log_level' at the beginning of your function.
2 - Use the tearDown function to reset the 'self.log_level' to the value you want for the rest of your testing module.

That's it ! XD
