### BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF SETUP AND CLEANUP MODULES ###

I - WTF are those ?

Those modules are respectively executed before and after all the tests.
Remember, as every malloc() involve a free(), a setup involve a cleanup!
If a setup method fail, the associate testing modules and cleanup methods will not be executed.
There the set_up and tear_down methods are available as well.


II - Creating a cleanup / setup couple

WARNING : The name of your modules and methods are important. There is a syntax to follow !

The MODULE'S NAME:
    Defined in the __str__() method, the name of the module should be in the following format:
        - For setup: "setup_ModuleName"
        - For cleanup: "cleanup_ModuleName"

The Methods:
    The corresponding setup and cleanup methods should have the exact same name !
    For example, if I have a method named "yolo_file" which create a file named "yolo" in your setup module, you should have
    a "yolo_file" method which remove the file named "yolo" in the corresponding cleanup module.
