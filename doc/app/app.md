## Overview

From this menu you can manage all your Vulture's applications. You can change their configurations and start / stop / reload Apache listeners.<br/><br/>
After any configuration change, you need to click on "Reload" in order to synchronize changes on disk. <br/>
This operation is safe and won't alter running applications, even if there is a mistake in your configuration: Vulture first checks your conf before stopping running processes.
<br/><br/>

On the top of the page you will see the list of listeners used by your applications:<br/>
